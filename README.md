This is not only a final Czechitas project but also a website for an upcoming photography exhibition called From Life to Life. A goal of the project created by Julia Dobrynina is to raise awareness about the challenges and triumphs faced by Ukrainian women refugees when seeking employment in the Czech Republic.
The website contains photos and personal stories of the portraited women. Our aim was to make a responsive website with an aesthetic design to which the visitors of the exhibiton could be redirected by scanning a QR code of the given portrait.
We used Figma to project the design of the entire website which significantly helped us when we were styling the website.
We decided to use headless CMS Contenftul in order to enable the photographer to upload her photos independently without undergoing any complex processes.  
As we planned to build a static website with a lot of photos, we opted for Next.js framework as it allows ,among other features, faster page loads.Along with Next.js we used TypeScript and its interface feature that that facilitated our work in spotting errors when entering the data type.
